# Ranked Match Calculator

## Description

This simple JavaScript function calculates the rank of a hero based on the number of wins and losses in ranked games. It was developed to meet the project challenge "Calculadora de Partidas Rankeadas" of the Bootcamp 'Programando do Zero' taught by DIO in partnership with PotÃªncia Tech By iFood.

## Usage

3. **Open the `index.js` file and customize the values of `wins` and `losses` in the `calculateRank` function.**

4. **Run the script:**

## Function Explanation

The `calculateRank` function takes the number of wins and losses as parameters and calculates the hero's rank based on predefined conditions. It then prints a message indicating the hero's balance and level.

### Rank Levels

- Iron: 0-10 wins
- Bronze: 11-20 wins
- Silver: 21-50 wins
- Gold: 51-80 wins
- Diamond: 81-90 wins

Feel free to customize the function and conditions based on your preferences.

Happy gaming!
